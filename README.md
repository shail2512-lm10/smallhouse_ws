# House Assistant Robot

This is a simulation-based project currently in process with the help of ROS and Gazebo. The main purpose of the robot is to assist humans in their home/work environment by doing various repetitive tasks. Currently, it is on the SLAM and autonomous navigation stage. The next step is to attach a 6 DoF arm and then add vision and deep learning capability for vision-based manipulation.
